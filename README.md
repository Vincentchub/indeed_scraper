# indeed_scraper
This is a single-file script that pulls company names, job titles, job descriptions and a links to the application pages for jobs in specified parameters and then writes them to a formatted .csv file

I intend to add further functionality to this project, such as scraping job qualifications and adding in the possiblity of including your own parameters. As it is, the parameterse are specified by indeed in the url included in the code (for instance, i searched for entry-level jobs with the 'python' tag within 50 miles of Dallas. This is easier to do through the indeed url because you can just create your desired filters and then simply copy/paste the resultant url into the script).

I have included a .csv file that serves as an example of the program's output.
